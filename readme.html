			Overview
		</h3>
		<p>
			SaverLab runs Mac OS X screensaver modules in regular windows. It allows you to run multiple modules simultaneously, pause, single step, and control the speed of the animations, and save animations as QuickTime movies.
			<p>
			When SaverLab launches, it locates all available screensaver modules and lists them in the "Modules" menu. Selecting a module from this menu opens a window in which the module runs. You can open any number of windows, including multiple copies of the same module, and they will all run simultaneously. You can resize the windows to any size you like; resizing will cause the screensaver to restart. You can also double-click a screensaver module in the Finder to open it.
			<p>
			Selecting "Show Browser" will open a window listing all available modules. Checking the "Show Preview" checkbox will expand the window to show a preview of the selected module. Double-clicking a module will open it. If the "Open In Preview Mode" checkbox is checked, double-clicking a module will open it in preview mode. This is useful for modules such as FreeFlow which try to switch the screen resolution when run in non-preview mode.
			<p>
			The "Preferences" item in the SaverLab menu allows you to set the default size for new windows, whether the module list window is shown when the application starts, and whether modules that were open in your previous session should be restored.
			<p>
			The "Control" menu allows you to control the screensaver module running in the frontmost window. The following commands are available:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pause/Resume</b>: Stops the animation of the screensaver module, or restarts it if it was already stopped.
				<li><b>Single Step</b>: Executes one "tick" of the screensaver module, which will usually cause it to animate a single frame. If the screensaver was not paused, this command will pause it.
				<li><b>Restart</b>: Resets the module's internal state and restarts the animation.
				<li><b>Speed Up</b>: Attempts to make the module run faster.
				<li><b>Slow Down</b>: Attempts to make the module run slower.
				<li><b>Show Info</b>: Opens an info window which shows and continuously updates the module's "Target FPS" (the number of frames per second it is trying to draw), "Current FPS" (the number of frames it drew in the last second), and content size.
				<li><b>Configure</b>: This command is only enabled if the screensaver module allows configuration. Selecting it opens the module's configuration sheet allowing you to customize its behavior.
                                <li><b>Toggle QuickTime Recording</b>: This command is used to start and stop recording animations. When you select it the first time, "RECORDING" will appear in the window's title bar. Every frame will be saved until you select this command again. When you do, recording will stop and you will be prompted for the location to save the QuickTime movie which will be created from the frames. A status window will open displaying the progress of creating the movie; clicking the "Cancel" button will abort the process.
			</ul>
			Single Step, Pause, Speed Up, and Slow Down do not work for all modules, see Known Bugs/Issues.
			<p>
			The "Window" menu allows you to set the properties of the active window. The "Front Layer", "Standard Layer", and "Back Layer" commands allow you to set the layer of the window. "Front Layer" causes the window to float above most other windows when it is not active. Use this if you always want the window visible. "Back Layer" causes the window to be displayed behind other windows, even when it is active. This is useful if you don't want the screen saver to obstruct your other windows. "Standard Layer" is the default, when it is selected the window is displayed normally.
			<p>
			The Window menu also shows several predefined window sizes, from 160x120 to 800x600. Selecting one will resize the front window to that size. Selecting the "Full Screen" command causes the window to fill the entire screen. Selecting the "Make Desktop Background" will make the window full screen and put it in the back layer, effectively producing an animated desktop. (However, any icons on the desktop will be covered).
			<p>
			The "Select Background Image..." command allows you to select a background image for the window. This command is only enabled for modules that do not use OpenGL, since OpenGL modules overwrite the background immediately. Selecting this command opens a file selection box, in which you can select any image that Mac OS X can handle (GIF, JPEG, and TIFF images, among others). If you select a readable image, the screensaver module will restart using the new background image.
			<p>
			SaverLab looks for screensaver modules in the same folders as does the Screen Saver Preferences panel. If you can see a screensaver in System Preferences, it should also be accessible in SaverLab. By default, the list of available modules is automatically updated every time SaverLab becomes the foreground application. This behavior can cause a short delay and can be disabled in the preferences window. The "Update List" command in the Modules menu will manually update the list of modules.

			<h3>
				Known Bugs/Issues
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Single Step function does not always work as expected. It does not work for some modules (in particular, the slide show modules that ship with Mac OS X) and it causes some other modules to reset to their initial state. This does not indicate a problem with those modules; it is due to the way SaverLab performs single steps.
				<li>The "Speed Up" and "Slow Down" commands have no effect on many modules.
				<li>Pausing and restarting certain modules causes them to revert to their initial state.
				<li>The minimize button is disabled in module windows because minimizing active windows produces erratic results.
				<li>All modules run in a single thread, so on multiprocessor machines only one CPU will be used. If you need to have all your CPUs drawing 3d galaxies as fast as possible, you can run a copy of SaverLab for each processor. QuickTime movies are created in separate threads, so multiprocessor machines should see some benefit there.
                                <li>In Mac OS X 10.1, the format of the slide show modules (Cosmos, Forest, etc.) has changed. As a result, if you try to run more than one different slide show module, after a short time all of them will show the images corresponding to the last module opened. A workaround is to run multiple copies of SaverLab with a different slide show module in each.
                                <li>Recording QuickTime movies requires a large amount of disk space. Each frame is stored uncompressed while recording, and the movie is saved with no compression. Long recordings can require tens or hundreds of megabytes.
